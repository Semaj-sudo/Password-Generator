# Password-Generator

## Introduction
I, James Lopez, had the pleasure of trying my hand with a random password generator, pwgenerator.png. After receiving a starting code for the HTML, I gave my best attempt to successfully create passwords between 8 and 128 characters, alpha numeric, with special characters. The trickiest portion was navigating in tandem with the prompts to give the password some preference.
