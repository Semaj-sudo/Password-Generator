# Password-Generator

## Introduction
I, James Lopez, had the pleasure of trying my hand with a random password generator, pwgenerator.png. After receiving a starting code for the HTML, I gave my best attempt to successfully create passwords between 8 and 128 characters, alpha numeric, with special characters. The trickiest portion was navigating in tandem with the prompts to give the password some preference. This is fully functional and can display the password with the a minimum of one character preference(uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
